# AsteroidsKnockoff

My version of asteroids
USER STORIES
User should be able to...
1.) Pick their name and start game at beginning
2.) Rotate ship L/R with arrow keys and fire lazer with "space" bar
3.) User(s) take turns defending/surviving
4.) See ship displayed in center of screen (static placement).
5.) Fire lazers at asteroids and destroy them to stay alive - if ship is struck ONCE then one life is taken away.

Minimally Viable Product Conditions

1.) Generate asteroid classes that have have varying speeds and approach vectors.
2.) Generate ship for user(s) that fires lasers (listeners for space bar), rotates left and right (listeners for left and right arrows), and stays static in center of displaly.
3.) Have styled display that shows following metrics: kills(represented in points per kill), timer and lives left (out of three).
4.) User(s) can select their name and start button starts the game.
5.) Game ends either when: a. Timer is up
                           b. Ship explodes, or timer runs out.

Nice to Haves...
1.) Sounds fx for lasers and explosions.
2.) Animate exploding asteroids.
3.) Have stats displayed: kill & damage.
4.) Theme song looping throughout (robot dubstep).


Stretches

1.) Glowing fireballs in later stage of game that travel quickly and emit light animation.
2.) Health boost @ certain conditions
3.) Customize ship and color options for user to select.
4.) Weapons upgrades at certain conditions
5.) Ship exploding animation when destroyed.
